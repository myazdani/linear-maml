# Experiments with Linear MAML

Model Agnostic Meta Learning, or MAML, is a method of learning in few shot tasks. The algorithm is trained over many different but related few shot tasks and tries to find paramters that serve as a good initialization for new novel tasks. 

MAML has many interesting ideas behind it and at first can be a bit difficult to grasp. To build better intuition for any new learning algorithm, it's always good to consider simple toy problems and models. In the case of MAML, we will start with simpler supervised linear regression.
